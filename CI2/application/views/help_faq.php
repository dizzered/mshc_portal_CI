<h3 style="color:#b88f01; font-weight:bold">Clean Charges Only Statements</h3>
<p>You not only have the option to print a Detailed Statement which lists all transactions for a case, but you can also print a:<br />
<br />
<ul class="faq_ul_disk">
    <li><strong>Charges</strong> only statement which omits any payment and adjustment transactions on the account.</li>
    <li><strong>Summary</strong> statement which is a one page summary of the Medical, Physical Therapy, MRI or Baltimore Work Rehab activity for the case.</li>
</ul>
<br />
Simply select the desired output drop down option next to the Statement Link before printing the statement.</p>
<br />
<h3 style="color:#b88f01; font-weight:bold">User Maintenance</h3>
<p>The Confidentiality Agreement signed by your firm when requesting access to the MSHC Attorney Portal specified that each firm agrees to <strong>"Allow access to our web portal ONLY to personnel who have an essential need for access and request access user names and identification unique to each individual."</strong><br />
<br />
Each firm has a designated user with User Maintenance Rights. This individual has the ability to:<br />
<br />
<ul class="faq_ul_disk">
<li >Assist each user in the firm with changing their password.</li>
<li >Unlock an account after too many unsuccessful login attempts.</li>
<li >Update the email address associated with each account.</li>
<li >Add new users to the portal for new employees of the firm.</li>
<li >Delete accounts of staff who are no longer employed by the firm.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br />
<h3 style="color:#b88f01; font-weight:bold">Client Search</h3>
<p>When searching for your clients, less is more. Rarely is it necessary to enter multiple search criteria. This also increases the possibility of entering incorrect information, resulting in a "<i>No records to display</i>." message. The more criteria that you enter, the more limited the results will be, so <strong style="text-decoration:underline">here are some tips</strong> to help you find your clients more easily.<br />
<br  />
<ul class="faq_ul_disk">
	<li ><strong>Attorneys</strong>: If you have multiple attorneys in your firm, use the Select All button in case the client is linked to a different attorney than first thought.</li>
	<li ><strong>Name</strong>: Enter only the last name or even a portion of the last name. Usually this is enough to locate the desired client. For common last names enter last name < space > a portion of the first name. Do not use a comma separator between the last and first name.</li>
	<li ><strong>Account</strong>: Searching by our internal account number, if you have it handy, is one of the most specific methods for locating an account.</li>
	<li ><strong>SSN</strong>: When searching by social security number, enter only the last 4 digits. This is usually sufficient to locate the client.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br />
<h3 style="color:#b88f01; font-weight:bold">Mileage Reimbursement Form</h3>
<p>If you produce Mileage Reimbursement Forms for your clients, we have an option that will make it a little easier.<br/>
<br />
<ul class="faq_ul_numeric">
	<li ><span>Access the <strong>Appointment History</strong> screen for your client either by clicking on the <span style="text-decoration:underline">History</span> link from the Client Search screen or from the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Appointments</span> link on the Case <strong>Summary</strong> screen.</span></li>
	<li ><span>You will want to filter the list to only include kept appointments.</span></li>
    	<ul class="faq_ul_disk">
		<li >Enter the word "<i>Kept</i>" in the filter block under the <strong>Status</strong> column heading. If it is not displaying click the Refresh button.</li>
		<li >Click the filter options button to the right of the field and select <strong>Contains</strong>.</li>
		<li >This will display only the appointments with a status of "Kept".</li>
        </ul>
	<li ><span>Next Click the <strong>Export to Excel</strong> or <strong>Export to Word</strong> option. This will automatically open the selected program and you will have a list of all of the appointments that can be reformatted to serve as a mileage report.</span></li>
</ul>
</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Note</strong>: We do have a Mileage Report enhancement planned to include an option that would not only produce this report for you, but will automatically calculate and include the distance from your client's home or work address to the MSHC office where the patient was seen. We will notify you when this becomes available.</p>
